A D - rotate ship ( + SHIFT to slow down rotation)
W S - throttle level controls  
SPACE  - push-to-max throttle (better use this)  

LMB - shoot cannon shell  
RMB - launch self-guided missiles (position mouse cursor on top to fire at desired target)

Ship hull will be destroyed in 3 shell hit, but slowly auto-repairing so 4 hits are needed to be sure.

Missile kills ship in one hit.

Mini-gun is auto-firing at closest target (act as close-in weapon system (point-defence))  
Most time it bringing targets down but may miss on simultaneous incoming missiles from different directions.
Misses targets in low orbit. So avoid catching incoming missiles while flying on it.
Doesn’t shoot at your missiles. (So launch missiles safely.)

Anti-missile system also help against inbound missiles on long range.
Doesn’t shoot at your missiles, but can unintentionally shoot them down.

Force shield can repulse several (~6) tangent hit or ~3 direct hit (fired from enemy ship flying towards you) by shell.
It's slowly regenerating to full charge, changing self colour.
Doesn’t repulse you shells so be carefull.

Green curve - you trajectory in planet gravity force.  
Blue curve - you shell trajectory in planet gravity force.

Difficulty levels  

Set one that fit you skill in StarGame/desktop/build/libs/config.ini  

1 - NEVER PLAYED  
2 - NOVICE  
3 - EXPERIENCED  
4 - SPECIALIST  
5 - IMPERIAL NAVY LIEUTENANT  
6 - IMPERIAL NAVY LORD-CAPITAN  

Code need refactoring, etc., but better if it was written in C++ to avoid using buffer objects for Vector2, 
GC related things, so i give up to do this.
