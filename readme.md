A D - rotate ship 
W S - throttle level controls
Space - push-to-max throttle (better use this)

LMB - fire cannon shell
RMB - launch self-guided missiles (position mouse cursor on top to fire at desired target)



Ship hull will destroyed in 3 shell hit, but slowly auto-repairing
so 4 needed to be sure.

Missile kill ship in one hit.

Minigun is auto-firing at close target (most time bringing it down).

Green curve - you trajectory in planet gravity force.
Blue curve - you shell trajectory in planet gravity force.

Force shield can repulse several (~4) hit from shell. It slowly regenerating to full charge.

It's deathmatch so enemy ship will search for new target on spawn or if its current target is destroyed.

No sounds are disabled due to libgdx  random stattering (~20 ms) when playing sound.




Difficulty level.

I'm testing with ru.geekbrains.screen.GameScreen.DIFFICULTY_LEVEL = 400;
So you you found too hard to you rebuild with DIFFICULTY_LEVEL = 1000;

DIFFICULTY_LEVEL == 100 seems been impossible to me.
